The rules of declaration:

Declaration is played with 6 players, split into two teams of 3. Typically, this is done by arranging players in alternating team order.

At the beginning of each match, every player is delt 9 cards out of a full 54 card deck. Declaration is a game played by completing sets.
There are 9 sets in each deck:
2 - 7 (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs)
9 - A (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs)
8s, Black Joker, Red Joker 

You complete a set by making a Declaration; this happens when you believe your team holds every card in a set, and you try to guess who in 
your team has each card of the set. If your guess is correct, then the set is played, and your team scores a point. 

This is accomplished through asks. When it is your turn to ask, you are allowed to ask any opponent with cards for a card that contributes to 
the sets of any card you are holding. You are NOT allowed to ask for a card you do not have any of the other cards in the set for. If the ask 
succeeds, i.e. the opponent you asked actually has that card, they must give you that card, and it is your turn to ask again. If the ask fails,
then the person you asked now has a turn to ask a member of your team. This cycle continues, as players run out of cards, they are effectively 
"out" of the game, and if they had a turn to ask, then the turn is transferred to the closest player to their left with cards. 

The game ends when a team scores 5 out of the 9 possible sets.
