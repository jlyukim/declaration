# Declaration Web Game Planning

## Minimum Viable Product

### Working Rules of Declaration
- Implementing hands for each player (including dealing random cards)
- Way to make valid asks (card in your set, opposing team)
  - Show if the ask worked or not
  - Display previous ask in the top right or something
- Way to make declarations
- Scoring declarations, ending games at 5 points
- Turn indicator (highlight around player name)
- Number of cards in each hand
- Colors for teams
- Figure out who starts (random/chosen)
- Decide who goes when a player runs out of cards (leftmost player?)

### Lobbies
- 6 users can join a lobby
- Joining lobby via code/url?
- Lobby owner can arrange the order of players/teams

### UI
- Main menu
- Game screen (just text/ascii?)
- Usernames
- Showing how many cards each player has
- High contrast cards

## Decisions

### How to Illustrate Asks?
- Speech bubble showing the card that is being asked
- Player being asked indicated by either their username in the bubble or an arrow?

### How to Illustrate the Result?
- Speech bubble for the ask-ee, with either an X for fail, and Y for success

## Potential Improvements
- Randomize teams
- Tutorial match with a set script
- "Training wheels mode" displaying previous asks
- Match history -> export to text file
- CPU opponents
  - Adjustable difficulties (give the cpu dementia i.e. move limit, only tracks sets it has)
- Match review, evaluation of how you did
- Elo system
- Skill-based matchmaking
- Tournament support
